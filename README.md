Description:
AMS (Application Monitoring Service) is the easiest way to log information about any Android application. This service has the ability to show information about the user or application behavior in a single, compact, and unified system. The service is split up into three sections: AMS Android library, AMS Webservice, and the AMS Dashboard. 


AMS Android Library:
This library is a simple import into the Android applciation and then it will communicate with the webservice. It has functions for error, info, success, and warning logging. Once a logging request is called (it's asynchronous so the user won't even notice it!), the device will send an XML to the webservice with the information specified where it will get logged.


AMS Webservice:
Once the webservice receives a uniquely structured XML file, it will parse it out and will save it into the database.

AMS Dashboard:
The dashboard acts completely separate from the library and the webservice and does not communicate with them at all. The goal is to display the data in the easiest way possible. Examples of the information shown: Android version pie chart, agrregated event information, user path table, total users graph, etc.
